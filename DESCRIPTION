Description: We provide an outlier robust alternative of the function ets() in the 'forecast' package of Hyndman and Khandakar (2008)<DOI:10.18637/jss.v027.i03>. For each method of a class of exponential smoothing variants we made a robust alternative. The class includes methods with a damped trend and/or seasonal components. The robust method is developed by robustifying every aspect of the original exponential smoothing variant. We provide robust forecasting equations, robust initial values, robust smoothing parameter estimation and a robust information criterion. The method is described in more detail in Crevits and Croux (2016)<DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.11791.18080>.
